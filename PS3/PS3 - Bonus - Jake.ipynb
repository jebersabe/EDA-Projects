- rethinking some of our accounting standards . like the tax code , our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science . in the process , we have fostered a technical , legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported .\\n enron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what \\' s going on in a business . like many companies today , enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities ( spes ) and other off - balance - sheet structures . such vehicles permit companies , like enron , to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet . wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings , which are well known to analysts and investors .\\n as the rules stand today , sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements , even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards . basing the accounting rules on a risk / reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity \\' s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet ; certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide . the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years . it \\' s time to rethink the rules .\\n - - modernizing our broken financial - reporting model . enron \\' s collapse , like the dot - com meltdown , is a reminder that our financial - reporting model - - with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings - per - share number - - is out of date and unresponsive to today \\' s new business models , complex financial structures , and associated business risks .\\n enron disclosed reams of information , including an eight - page management \\' s discussion & analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report . some analysts studied these , sold short and made profits . but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that , although they were confused , they bought and lost money .\\n we need to fix this problem . we can \\' t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial - reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past , but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what \\' s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future .\\n the current financial - reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age . that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few . there were no derivatives . no structured off - balance - sheet financings . no instant stock quotes or mutual funds . no first call estimates . and no lou dobbs or cnbc .\\n we need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model . disclosurs needs to be continuous , not periodic , to reflect today \\' s 24 / 7 capital markets . we need to provide several streams of relevant information . we need to expand the number of key performance indicators , beyond earnings per share , to present the information investors really need to understand a company \\' s business model and its business risks , financial structure and operating performance .\\n - - reforming our patchwork regulatory environment . an alphabet soup of institutions - - from the aicpa ( american institute of certified public accountants ) to the sec and the asb ( auditing standards board ) , eitf ( emerging issues task force ) and fasb ( financial accounting standards board ) to the pob ( public oversight board ) - - all have important roles in our profession \\' s regulatory framework . they are all made up of smart , diligent , well - intentioned people . but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today \\' s complex financial issues . standard - setting is too slow . responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession .\\n all of us must focus on ways to improve the system . agencies need more resources and experts . processes need to be redesigned . the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review , and address them . some criticisms are off the mark , but some are well deserved . for our part , we intend to work constructively with the sec , congress , the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest .\\n - - improving accountability across our capital system . unfortunately , we have witnessed much of this before . two years ago , scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects . the dot - com bubble cost investors trillions . it \\' s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us .\\n in particular , we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises . millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security .\\n of course , investors look to management , directors and accountants . but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders . they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework - - and walk away from companies they don \\' t understand . they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep . for our system to work in today \\' s complex economy , these checks and balances must function properly .\\n enron reminds us that the system can and must be improved . we are prepared to do our part .\\n -

the - street rival breached its merger agreement by breaking off the deal this past week .\\n the suits escalate a war of words between the two houston companies over who was responsible for the merger breakup that contributed to enron \\' s tumble into bankruptcy - court proceedings and they threaten to be a serious distraction for dynegy , another energy - trading highflier .\\n credit agencies continue to penalize dynegy for gambling on an effort to buy enron , and dynegy \\' s stock is off more than those of other companies with significant energy - trading operations . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 each , below their 52 - week low .\\n \" there is no question that something as high - profile as this will attract senior management \\' s attention for some time , \" said robert grossman , chief credit officer with debt - rating agency fitch inc . , which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger . \" the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors \\' minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile , \" says ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .\\n still , dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy - trading business . dynegy \\' s president and chief operating officer , steve bergstrom , who worked for enron in the early 1980 s , is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines , production and power - plant capacity to complement its trading operations .\\n as enron was cratering last week , dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron \\' s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural - gas - supply deals . as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers , \" dynegy was a direct beneficiary , \" an enron trader said yesterday . \" when we couldn \\' t do it , people just thought ` let \\' s go across the street and talk to dynegy . \\' \" he said dynegy was offering the best deals late last week .\\n since oct . 1 , the number of customers executing agreements on dynegydirect , dynegy \\' s online trading platform , has increased 20 % and dynegy \\' s physical trading business also has increased , mr . bergstrom told analysts yesterday . \" we continue to experience a clear flight to quality by customers , \" he said . \" we will not be distracted by these events . \"\\n many enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company . \" these traders are going to be looking for jobs and maintaining their relationships will be very important , and they may even be interviewing at dynegy , \" said jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons thomson financial / datastream\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones now , lifeline is sought for trading unit\\n by wall street journal staff reporters mitchell pacelle , jathon sapsford and ann davis\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n the wall street journal\\n a 3\\n ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\\n turning to some of its largest creditors as potential saviors , enron corp . secured as much as $ 1 . 5 billion in new financing from j . p . morgan chase the move comes after enron \\' s $ 10 billion suit against\\n dynegy filed sunday for breaching its merger agreement .\\n -

law proceeding ?\\n in the case of enron corp . , about 30 . that \\' s the number of attorneys new york law firm weil , gotshal & manges , enron \\' s bankruptcy counsel , says it had on the case before it was filed over the weekend in federal bankruptcy court in new york .\\n enron \\' s chapter 11 filing , one of the largest in corporate history , is also apt to be one of the most lucrative - - for lawyers representing the company and those counseling its creditors , as well as an expected army of financial advisers and turnaround pros .\\n the slackening economy and the burst of large chapter 11 cases - - five of the 15 biggest chapter 11 s of all time have been filed this year - - have left the formerly insular bankruptcy bar busier than ever and with a new cachet . with demand growing , rates are rising , reaching $ 700 an hour for the top lawyers . that is starting to put bankruptcy lawyers in the same league with merger specialists and trial attorneys . the pending chapter 11 case of pg & e corp . \\' s utility unit this spring , some experts predict , could generate legal and other fees topping $ 400 million .\\n \" the phone has been jumping off the hook , \" said andrew rahl , a partner and bankruptcy specialist at anderson kill & olick in new york . mr . rahl says his firm already has been retained by one client in the enron case , who he declines to identify , and is actively negotiating with two others .\\n besides weil , enron has retained new york firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher & flom as \" special counsel \" to represent its outside board members , among other tasks . heading the team : mergers specialist peter atkins , best known for representing a special committee of rjr nabisco inc . in the $ 25 billion takeover fight celebrated in the best - selling book , \" barbarians at the gate . \"\\n enron \\' s bank creditors , who hold a chunk of the company \\' s $ 13 billion in debt , have lined up two large wall street firms of their own . shearman & sterling is advising longtime client citigroup inc . \\' s citibank while j . p . morgan chase & co . has retained davis , polk & wardwell , and partner donald bernstein , a restructuring specialist who has represented the bank in the pending bethlehem steel corp . chapter 11 proceeding , also in new york , among others . among other major creditor firms is boston \\' s bingham dana , which has been retained by the structured - finance unit of general electric co . \\' s general electric capital corp .\\n litigation between enron and its erstwhile merger partner , dynegy inc . , is also expected to trigger many billable hours . dynegy , which sued enron yesterday , seeking the right to complete the acquisition of enron \\' s crown jewel pipeline system , has retained houston firm baker botts , along with akin gump strauss hauer & feld , based in dallas and washington . enron , which launched its own pre - emptive lawsuit in bankruptcy court on sunday against dynegy , is represented by weil securities litigator greg danilow and corporate chief thomas roberts , who recently handled amr corp . \\' s acquisition of trans world airlines in delaware bankruptcy court .\\n martin bienenstock , weil gotshal \\' s chief bankruptcy lawyer on the enron case , said rates of firm partners likely to be involved in the matter range from $ 450 to $ 700 an hour . mr . bienenstock , who charges a $ 675 hourly rate , has recently represented holders of millions in bonds issued by excite @ home corp . , as well as such bankruptcy - law debtors as ames department stores inc . and g - i holdings inc . , an asbestos concern . with 80 bankruptcy lawyers , one of the largest such law - firm practices in the country , he added , \" you can do a lot more . \"\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n fall of a power giant : now is the time for creditors to vie against each other\\n by henny sender\\n staff reporter of the wall street journal\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n the wall street journal\\n al 0\\n ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\\n enron corp . \\' s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors .\\n filings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron \\' s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company \\' s dealings . but for now , few of enron \\' s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover , thanks to enron \\' s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company \\' s balance sheet .\\n in its chapter 11 filing , enron corp . listed $ 13 . 15 billion in debt . when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings , on - balance - sheet debt totals $ 31 . 24 billion . some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional $ 27 billion in off - balance - sheet and contingent liabilities . the combined list of creditors attached to enron \\' s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long .\\n precisely because there are so many claims , the contesting among enron \\' s creditors is expected to be especially fierce . while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims - - with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid , the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom - - bankruptcy proceedings aren \\' t always set in stone .\\n \" chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses , \" said stephen case , a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york .\\n in coming weeks , enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors , who buy distressed debt , for information about the ultimate value of the company .\\n until now , many distressed - debt players have been on the sidelines , citing the impossibility of understanding enron \\' s business operations , the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron .\\n \" traditionally , immediately after a bankruptcy filing , a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company , \" said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york . \" it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available . \"\\n \" after a filing , the paper tends to get concentrated , \" added mr . case of davis polk . \" many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don \\' t want to be seen in [ or aren \\' t allowed to hold ] defaulted paper . so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands . \"\\n complicating the negotiations : claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests , reflecting enron \\' s combination of physical and financial assets - - thousands and thousands of financial contracts , whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious .\\n usually , it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets . in order to compete , the savviest creditors , such as the distressed - debt funds , which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices , engage in a variety of strategies . for instance , they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn - out legal battle unless concessions are made . or , because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement , one party may buy up others \\' claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class - - enough to influence the entire outcome .\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n auditor andersen is added to enron 401 ( k ) lawsuit\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n the wall street journal\\n al 0\\n ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\\n houston -

built baseball stadium , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay announced that the high - flying energy giant would pay roughly $ 100 million over 30 years to put its name on the new home of the houston astros .\\n that was well before fatal questions arose about enron \\' s questionable finances . but after that , enron never had a chance . it was destined to join fruit of the loom inc . , trans world airlines , psinet inc . and others that spiraled downward after emblazoning their brand names on sports stadiums . it \\' s as if putting a corporate name on a stadium is an act of such hubris that the sports gods demand retribution .\\n for fruit of the loom , that meant filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999 , three years after putting its pro player athletic - wear label on miami \\' s football and baseball stadium . twa took down its shingle from the home of football \\' s st . louis rams earlier this year , after being acquired out of bankruptcy by american airlines . and psinet , a new - economy telecom firm that agreed in 1999 to pay more than $ 100 million over 20 years for naming rights to the baltimore ravens \\' new football stadium , filed for bankruptcy protection in june .\\n call it the stadium -

networking equipment , were trading at $ 39 . 50 on sept . 7 , 1995 , when it agreed to pay $ 1 million a year to put its name on san francisco \\' s windswept candlestick park , generating howls of local protest . six years , several corporate reorganizations and one tech downturn later , 3 com last month said it had had enough and told football \\' s san francisco 49 ers it didn \\' t want to renew . 3 com shares closed at $ 4 . 66 in 4 p . m . nasdaq stock market trading yesterday .\\n compaq computer corp . doubled down on stadiums , attaching its name to indoor arenas in houston , its hometown , and in san jose , calif . now , compaq is struggling to sell itself to hewlett -

naming deals .\\n in baltimore , many fans had never heard of psinet before its name was affixed , in big purple letters , to the ravens \\' stadium . psinet \\' s bankruptcy filing is \" an embarrassment and predictable result of the shortsighted greed of ownership , \" says attorney and football fan neil brafman . he suggests renaming the ballpark \" creditors \\' committee stadium . \" in houston , longtime astro season -

game really started in 1973 , when rich foods paid $ 1 . 5 million to put its name on the home of football \\' s buffalo bills for 25 years . it was another 15 years before atlantic richfield co . and great western financial corp . put their names on basketball arenas in sacramento , calif . , and los angeles in 1988 . now , there are 62 major - league stadiums sporting the names of companies , which have agreed to pay a collective $ 3 . 4 billion for the privilege , over as long as 30 years , according to dean bonham , a naming - rights consultant in denver .\\n as the deals have multiplied , the jinx has spread . beyond bankruptcies and other brushes with death , corporate stadium - namers are frequent takeover targets . arco , for example , was acquired by bp plc last year . pacific telesis , parent of pacific bell , agreed to be acquired by sbc communications the day before it announced a $ 50 million naming - rights deal with the san francisco giants in 1996 . shawmut national corp . paid to put its name on a new indoor arena in boston in 1993 , but the company was acquired by fleetboston financial corp . before a single game was played . the philadelphia arena formerly known as the corestates center morphed into the first union center and will become the wachovia center as soon as next summer .\\n the deteriorating financial health of airlines imperils naming deals at six indoor arenas . the former chief executive of ual corp . , whose united airlines unit named the arena in chicago , raised the prospect of filing for bankruptcy next year . some analysts believe the parent of america west airlines , namer of the arena in phoenix , may have to file sooner , if it doesn \\' t get requested government aid .\\n not every naming - rights deal leads inexorably to a company \\' s demise . general motors corp . ( whose name graces the arena of hockey \\' s vancouver canucks ) and pepsico inc . ( the denver nuggets and colorado avalanche ) are in no danger of disappearing . ( of course , the same would have been said about enron a few months ago . ) those who pay the big bucks believe they are getting their money \\' s worth for stadium deals , through improved name recognition and an association with active lifestyles .\\n \" it provided a unique branding opportunity that only comes around every so often , \" says robert waldrop , senior vice president of communications at reliant resources inc . , another houston energy firm . reliant last year agreed to pay roughly $ 300 million over 32 years to put its name on a football stadium for the houston texans , who will begin play next year , and adjacent livestock show and convention center . mr . waldrop says it would be \" a real long stretch \" to associate enron \\' s woes with its stadium - naming deal .\\n consultants say the deals are particularly useful for companies that are not household names , such as european electronics giants telefon ab l . m . ericsson and koninklijke philips electronics nv . philips uses part of the atlanta arena that it named as a showcase for its products .\\n still , consultants say prices for stadium - naming deals are drifting lower , because of the weak economy and the disappearance of internet firms , many of which were active bidders . more than a dozen u . s . stadiums and arenas are seeking sponsors , including the superdome in new orleans , home to february \\' s super bowl , comiskey park in chicago , and the former trans world dome in st . louis . wayne huizenga , who owns the dolphins and pro player stadium , has been seeking a replacement sponsor for more than a year .\\n some companies say they \\' ve learned to shy away . \" it \\' s very expensive , \" says kristin schroer , a spokeswoman for southwest airlines , one of the few major airlines that doesn \\' t have its name on an arena . \" we would rather be able to charge our passengers lower fares so they can afford to fly to games and still have money in their pocket to buy a foam finger or eat out . \"\\n -

managers are expected to seek shares this way . but others , including u . s . investors , who can \\' t participate in the rights portion , are expected to wait until afterward . they have until thursday evening to order shares but , unlike with the rights issue , can specify at what price they \\' re willing to buy . many aren \\' t expected to place their orders before thursday .\\n \" if you \\' re a recent investor , you may well want to take up your full rights , \" said an asset manager at a major dutch pension fund . \" but if you purchased shares in the last offering [ in november 2000 ] , at 17 euros , you \\' re not going to be eager to buy more kpn shares . \"\\n the share offering nonetheless comes at a time when investors are turning more positive toward the telecom sector in general after shunning it for more than a year . finland \\' s sonera corp . , another heavily indebted telecom group , raised one billion euros through a heavily discounted rights issue to existing shareholders last month .\\n the mood has soured somewhat in recent days , hurt by signs that the u . s . economy won \\' t recover as quickly as investors had been hoping . the collapse of enron corp . also has refocused investor attention on credit risk .\\n investors note that it \\' s particularly difficult to estimate kpn \\' s fair value because its heavy debt load means a small change in financial assumptions about the company can create a big change in the valuation .\\n \" we like telecoms as a house , and we think they should be overweighted \" in a portfolio , says alia baig , a london - based european portfolio manager at axa investment managers , which has gbp 160 billion in assets under management . \" individually we \\' re very particular about what stocks we do like , and we tend to prefer mobile [ operators ] over fixed - line [ operators ] . \"\\n kpn isn \\' t a \" must - own \" stock , she said and she doesn \\' t intend to exercise her rights . she predicts the final share price won \\' t be above four euros and says the price would have to be between three euros and 3 . 50 euros to be interested . \" that \\' s just to reflect the risk in the turnaround and that there \\' s new management . \"\\n but joost eijsink , an asset manager at dutch investment bank eureffect , predicted that while selling pressure will increase throughout the week , most of the fall in the share price has already occurred .\\n \" last week there was a lot of optimism over the issue price , with a lot of people seeing it somewhere between five euros and 5 . 50 euros , \" he said . \" people were maybe a little too positive . \"\\n mr . eijsink said funds the firm manages are likely to subscribe to the issue . but its advice to other clients will vary .\\n -

go world of commodity trading are finding their own profits and accounting practices under scrutiny as well .\\n what ultimately triggered the collapse of investor confidence in enron were its indecipherable disclosures for related - party transactions , compounded by its admitted financial misstatements and massive off - balance - sheet liabilities . but many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the financial statements of most companies that trade electricity , natural gas and the like - - with the approval of the nation \\' s accounting - rule makers .\\n at issue is a technique called \" mark to market \" accounting , under which the financial accounting standards board has given energy traders wide discretion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in future periods from energy - related contracts and other derivative instruments .\\n for many energy - trading companies , significant chunks of earnings in recent years have come from recording unrealized , noncash gains through such accounting entries . often , these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors , details of which the companies don \\' t provide . and because of the minimal disclosure standards , it is difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive , or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions - - and force earnings revisions .\\n \" whenever there \\' s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings , one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals , \" says abn amro analyst paul patterson , who follows energy - trading firms .\\n mark - to - market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy - related contracts on their balance sheets , either as assets or liabilities , at the end of a quarter . for example , these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices . under the rules , companies estimate the fair values of the contracts . quarterly changes in value - - representing unrealized , noncash gains and losses - - then are run through the companies \\' income statements .\\n one way to gauge the size of some companies \\' past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash - flow statements , which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains . at enron , unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company \\' s $ 1 . 41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of $ 1 . 13 billion in 1999 .\\n at dynegy , unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its $ 762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its $ 227 million in 1999 pretax profit . dynegy executives say there isn \\' t anything wrong with the quality of their company \\' s earnings . and they point to financial reports for the first nine months of 2001 showing that none of the company \\' s reported earnings for this year came from unrealized gains .\\n other energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by mark - to - market gains include american electric power , duke energy , el paso , entergy , mirant , pinnacle west capital and williams cos .\\n how much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts ? the rule , pretty much , is that there aren \\' t many rules .\\n for instance , during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association , attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from $ 40 million to $ 153 million , depending on which assumptions of future trends were used .\\n and the mark - to - market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for . \" we developed those rules , \" enron \\' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an august interview .\\n over the past three years , members of the fasb \\' s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy - related contracts . what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion , though the task force recognizes that could create problems . in a june 2000 report , for instance , the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts , resulting in widely different valuations . \" those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value , \" the report said .\\n the task force \\' s chairman , tim lucas , says it simply is too difficult to draft a one - size - fits - all solution : \" there \\' s no one way to do it . there are various models , and we think it requires professional judgment to assess . \" further , he says , requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlying their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would be of little value .\\n that is in line with the industry \\' s longtime position . in a june 2000 letter to mr . lucas , for instance , mr . causey said \" the valuation process should be determined by individual companies , \" and the task force \" should not address the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts . \"\\n in its financial filings , dynegy explains that when market - price quotes aren \\' t available for certain long - term contracts , \" the lack of long - term pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments . \" as a result , actual cash returns may \" vary , either positively or negatively , from the results estimated . \"\\n quoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short - term energy contracts have become more readily available in recent years . even then , there aren \\' t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use . for instance , should companies mark their contracts based on the \" bid \" price , which is the price a market maker would offer to pay for a given contract ? or should they use the \" ask \" price , which is the price at which a trader is willing to sell ? or somewhere in between ? currently , individual companies decide for themselves .\\n on most contracts for short - term deliveries of natural gas , bid - ask spreads are fairly small , about 1 % or so . but even for some short - term electricity contract prices quoted on enron \\' s now - shuttered online trading portal , spreads of 20 % were common . on contracts for short - term delivery of telecommunications bandwidth , enron often posted \" ask \" prices that were as much as eight times the posted \" bid \" prices .\\n for other long - term derivatives , such as electricity contracts stretching 20 years or longer , market quotes don \\' t exist . in such cases , companies are allowed to base contract valuations on their own undisclosed estimates , covering everything from future commodity prices to credit risks and discount rates .\\n \" it would seem wise for energy companies in this highly skeptical environment to provide the disclosures necessary for financial statement readers to understand the quality of their earnings , and provide the disclosures voluntarily , \" says tom linsmeier , an accounting professor at michigan state university .\\n for now , however , energy traders aren \\' t stepping up their disclosures . dynegy \\' s senior vice president and controller , michael mott , for instance , says his company \" is committed to full disclosure and to eliminate any cloudiness around these disclosures . \" but he says dynegy won \\' t disclose any information about the market assumptions or methodologies underlying the unrealized gains it has recorded over the years . he says that would place dynegy \" at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace . \"\\n -

- the bankruptcy of enron has washington debating the way it oversees the $ 200 billion power industry . but there is no consensus on erasing the legacy of deregulation that the company \\' s political largess helped forge .\\n congressional leaders and top regulators are moving forward on what had been enron \\' s no . 1 objective : a push to reduce local control of electricity transmission lines so that energy merchants like the enron corporation can use them to transport and sell power .\\n but the politics of power are shifting , and some of enron \\' s longstanding opponents - - chief among them the southern company of atlanta , which owns many local power monopolies - - see a fresh chance to slow deregulation , or even roll it back .\\n among those who have called for inquiries into enron \\' s collapse are representative billy tauzin , a prominent republican from louisiana who is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee ; the senate majority leader , tom daschle , and senator jeff bingaman , a democrat of new mexico who is chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee .\\n all are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business reversals in history . and some members of congress say enron \\' s downfall , on the heels of california \\' s energy meltdown early this year , proves that washington must demand more disclosure from energy traders , holding them at least to the standards of wall street firms .\\n \\' \\' enron is the sequela to california , it \\' s all part of the one - year story line , \\' \\' said representative edward j . markey , democrat of massachusetts , who focuses on energy regulatory issues in the house . \\' \\' we can \\' t leave energy products in the regulatory shadows . it hurts both investors and consumers . \\' \\'\\n other influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregulation .\\n \\' \\' we have had a number of false starts , and it would be crazy not to take a look at the lessons we can learn , \\' \\' said nora brownell , one of president bush \\' s appointees this year to the federal energy regulatory commission . \\' \\' but we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not work . \\' \\'\\n the bush administration , along with some democrats - - including mr . bingaman and william massey , a democrat on the energy commission - - continue to favor plans advanced by enron that would pry open regional electricity markets .\\n \\' \\' we have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of enron \\' s collapse , \\' \\' mr . bingaman said . \\' \\' but i don \\' t see anything in this that would keep us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of things . \\' \\'\\n the durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets .\\n enron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush \\' s campaigns over the years , and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company . since 1993 , its employees and its chairman , kenneth l . lay , have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush . in the 2000 election cycle , more than $ 1 million was donated to federal political campaigns , most of it to republicans .\\n mr . lay also had powerful friends . he recruited wendy l . gramm , the top commodities regulator in the administration of president bush \\' s father and the wife of senator phil gramm , republican of texas , to serve on enron \\' s board in 1993 . the appointment came just five weeks after ms . gramm helped push through a ruling at the commodity futures trading commission that exempted many energy contracts from regulation .\\n last year , as congress and the clinton administration debated whether to exercise more oversight of the financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts , mr . lay courted linda robertson , a senior treasury official who was the department \\' s liaison with congress .\\n ms . robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury , her financial disclosure shows . the measure that became law , the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 , specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money , securities and commodities .\\n ms . robertson , who became the head of enron \\' s washington office , did not return a phone call seeking comment .\\n last spring , when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy , mr . lay had a 30 - minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report . the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks , an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr . lay discussed during his meeting with mr . cheney .\\n enron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr . bush \\' s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees the markets in which enron operates . mr . lay met mr . bush \\' s personnel adviser , clay johnson , to discuss nominees . when mr . bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five - member commission , both had the backing of enron as well as other companies .\\n enron did not always get its way in washington . it failed to win regulatory exemptions for some futures products it wanted to trade , for example . and with enron now discredited , its longtime nemeses like the southern company hope to turn the regulatory agenda in a direction that favors their interests .\\n the southern company has long been enron \\' s main challenger for influence in washington . the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers - - the senate minority leader , trent lott of mississippi , most prominent among them - - in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation .\\n so far this year , its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies , including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil , in supporting members of congress , according to the u . s . public interest research group . southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing , production and transmission .\\n \\' \\' we have long felt that enron \\' s vision of open markets does not work with electricity , \\' \\' said dwight evans , executive vice president of the southern company . \\' \\' i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events . \\' \\'\\n mr . evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr . bush had tried to \\' \\' design systems that meet what enron needs . \\' \\' congress should slow the commission , mr . evans argued , or risk a fresh bout of instability and volatile prices .\\n some states have halted the introduction of open markets for electricity . nevada , oklahoma and new mexico are among those that have put off deregulation , while california and a few other states that once promoted unfettered competition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control .\\n enron \\' s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government interference could be another casualty of its collapse .\\n as the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars - - at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactions passed through enron \\' s trading operation , by some estimates - - enron scrambled to hold off congress and regulators .\\n but some regulatory experts now say that enron \\' s collapse is reminiscent of the failure of long - term capital management . long - term capital was the hedge fund based in greenwich , conn . , that operated without direct federal oversight and , by some accounts , threatened world markets when its elaborate portfolio of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 .\\n with its exemption from scrutiny in hand , enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio , leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits . enron \\' s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks , after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives .\\n \\' \\' enron was getting very heavily into derivatives , and along with wall street banks , they went to bat to keep us away , \\' \\' said michael greenberger , who was director of trading and markets at the commodities futures trading commission until early this year . \\' \\' this should be as scary for regulators and congress as long - term capital was . \\' \\'\\n representative markey agreed that congress should demand more oversight of energy trading . he said regulators should begin requiring transparency from companies like enron , while examining the adequacy of their capital and the stability of their trading portfolio , much as banking and securities regulators do for companies in their domain .\\n \\' \\' we \\' ll do it now , \\' \\' he said , \\' \\' or we \\' ll do it when we get the next shock . \\' \\'\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c\\n the markets : stocks & bonds\\n as investors worry about mideast and enron , shares fall\\n by reuters\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n the new york times\\n page 11 , column 3\\n c . 2001 new york times company\\n stocks fell yesterday with selling generated by a sudden leap in middle east hostilities and concern about the corporate fallout from enron , the former wall street darling that is now the largest bankruptcy case in american history .\\n these concerns overshadowed the optimism that made november the best month for the market since april , with a 7 . 5 percent gain in the broad standard & poor \\' s 500 -

- - the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what ( if anything ) enron \\' s buddies have done on behalf of the company . the upcoming hearings in the republican - controlled house should be fascinating , and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic - controlled senate .\\n \" we \\' ve had no contact with the white house \" since enron \\' s meltdown started , says company spokesman mark palmer .\\n \" i \\' m not aware that there have been any requests [ from enron ] for anything , \" a white house spokesman says .\\n even though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out , lay isn \\' t going to the poorhouse . unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn \\' t let them sell , lay has plenty of wealth left . last year alone , he made $ 123 million of profit on stock options , according to enron filings . this year he has made an additional $ 25 million or so . note : on friday , with its stock at around 30 cents , enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it .\\n ironically , what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list ( no . 7 ) is that the markets , whose virtue it preached , lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer .\\n and now , let \\' s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 :\\n 1 . bubbles didn \\' t end\\n when dot - coms bombed\\n enron , a major trader of electricity and natural gas , grossed $ 200 billion a year and had $ 60 billion of assets , but it turned out to be a bubble . its business depended on borrowing lots of money . people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy . when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems , money trickled away . then it started leaving in a flood . as enron tottered , it lost trading business . its remaining customers began to gouge it - - that \\' s how trading works in the real world . don \\' t blame the usual suspects : stock analysts . rather , blame arthur andersen , enron \\' s outside auditor , which didn \\' t blow the whistle until it was too late . ( andersen says it \\' s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions . )\\n 2 . deregulation can be dangerous\\n it \\' s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up , given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems . besides , breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid . letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else . but dereg has caused lots of problems . in 1998 , the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts : some utilities had sold power outside their service areas , and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn \\' t deliver . upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states , sticking established players with big costs . and , of course , there \\' s california , which got caught with too little energy in the spring ( helping enron and others make big profits ) and now is stuck with too much expensive energy . this has crippled the state \\' s finances , driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers . leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky . especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight .\\n 3 . beware your own hype\\n enron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas , and it was the primo player in that field . but it came to believe that it was good at everything . it wasn \\' t . some of the debacles : losses of $ 2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses , and another $ 2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment . it blew an additional $ 1 billion on an electricity - generating plant in india . hence , i think , the need to obscure rising debt levels and less - than - stellar results by dealing with so - called off - balance - sheet partnerships with \" star wars \" names such as jedi ( for joint energy development investments ) and chewco ( as in chewbacca , the wookiee ) . the fact that enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money while the company got clocked didn \\' t help .\\n the summary\\n the enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are . to wit : when someone tells you he \\' s changing the world for the better and getting rich at the same time , hold onto your wallet . and when something sounds too good to be true , it probably isn \\' t true .\\n michael isikoff contributed to this column .\\n sloan is newsweek \\' s wall street editor . his e -

be rescuer , over the causes of its monumental collapse .\\n enron told most of its houston workers to go home and await word on whether their jobs were gone . meanwhile , dynegy filed a countersuit against enron demanding ownership of one of its major pipeline networks - - an asset dynegy was promised when it advanced $ 1 . 5 billion to enron as part of its aborted nov . 9 takeover agreement .\\n the legal battle began sunday , when enron filed a $ 10 billion damage suit against dynegy , claiming it was forced into a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding when dynegy pulled back its purchase offer following intense negotiations the weekend after thanksgiving .\\n dynegy \\' s chairman and chief executive , chuck watson , said yesterday in a conference call that enron \\' s lawsuit \" is one more example of enron \\' s failure to take responsibility for its own demise . \"\\n \" enron \\' s rapid disintegration , \" he added , follows \" a general loss of public confidence in its leadership and credibility . \"\\n dynegy \\' s shares fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10 percent , to $ 27 . 17 yesterday because of investors \\' fears that the bankruptcy process will tie up dynegy \\' s claim to the omaha - based northern natural gas co . pipeline , forcing it to write down the $ 1 . 5 billion payment to enron .\\n \" dynegy is now entangled in this enron mess , \" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade .\\n \" investors fear the $ 1 . 5 billion investment might not be easily converted into ownership of the pipeline , \" said tom burnett , president of merger insight , an affiliate of wall street access , a new york - based brokerage and financial adviser .\\n on the broader impact of enron \\' s bankruptcy , donald e . powell , chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp . , said in an interview that regulators believe so far that losses on loans to the ailing energy company will be painful but not large enough to cause any bank to fail . however , he said that the ripple effect on other enron creditors , who in turn may find it harder to repay bank loans , is more difficult to gauge .\\n \" enron is a complex company , \" said powell . \" it will take some time to digest the consequences to the banking industry . \" the fdic insures deposits at the nation \\' s 9 , 747 banks and thrifts .\\n shares of enron \\' s major european bank lenders also fell yesterday on overseas markets .\\n the stock price of j . p . morgan chase , one of enron \\' s lead bankers , fell 3 percent , or $ 1 . 17 , to $ 36 . 55 . enron told a bankruptcy court judge in manhattan that it has arranged up to $ 1 . 5 billion in financing from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to keep operating as it reorganizes under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , according to the associated press .\\n the charges and countercharges between enron and dynegy are the opening rounds in a what legal experts predict will be a relentless battle between the two houston companies .\\n hundreds of lawyers representing investors and employees are lining up to question enron executives and the former enron officials who quit or were fired in the past four months as the fortunes of the powerful energy trading company disintegrated .\\n ahead of them are securities and exchange commission investigators probing whether enron concealed critical information about its problems from shareholders . investigators from the house energy and commerce committee are headed for houston this week to pursue a congressional inquiry into the largest bankruptcy action in u . s . history .\\n and in the lead position is u . s . bankruptcy judge arthur j . gonzalez in new york , who has sweeping powers under federal law to oversee claims against enron , as the company tries to restore its trading business and settle creditors \\' claims .\\n dynegy \\' s immediate goal is to have the ownership of the northern gas pipeline decided in state court in texas , where the companies are located , said dynegy attorney b . daryl bristow of baker botts .\\n \" could the bankruptcy court try to put the brakes on this ? they could . we \\' ll be in court trying to stop it from happening , \" bristow said .\\n staff writer kathleen day contributed to this report .\\n http : / / www . washingtonpost . com\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n editorial\\n enron \\' s \\' con \\'\\n richard cohen\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n the washington post\\n final\\n a 25\\n copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved\\n as usual , i was awakened by a sudden draft through the closed windows , saw the curtains ominously rustling and sensed instantly that someone was in my bedroom . without even looking up i knew it had to be my grandfather , this long -

- a takeover that fell through partly as a result of falls in enron \\' s stock price .\\n a similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms . auditors are supposed to serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies \\' financial statements . but auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on information technology and other management issues . the desire to win consulting contracts may reduce auditors \\' appetite for dust - ups with companies whose accounts seem suspicious . enron \\' s auditor , arthur andersen , earned $ 27 million in consulting fees from the company last year - - slightly more than the $ 25 million it got paid to audit enron \\' s books . at the same time it failed to challenge enron \\' s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in partnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet .\\n the conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors , while similar , demand different remedies . investors themselves are in a position to correct some of the stockbroker problem : they can ignore advice from analysts at the integrated investment banks , and route their business through smaller independent stockbrokers . but the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulators at the securities and exchange commission . the commission \\' s last chairman , arthur levitt , took a tough line with the auditors ; his successor , harvey pitt , has struck a softer tone . with luck , mr . pitt will now adopt more of his predecessor \\' s outlook . without objective auditing , there will be more and more enrons - - and more and more investors , lenders and employees who get unfairly burned .\\n http : / / www . washingtonpost . com\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk\\n enron slashes jobs , lines up financing energy : funding of $ 1 . 5 billion is intended to keep trading operations going amid move to reorganize .\\n chris kraul ; thomas s . mulligan\\n times staff writers\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n los angeles times\\n home edition\\n c -

1\\n copyright 2001 / the times mirror company\\n enron corp . warned electricity customers monday that it might be unable to serve them all because of the financial problems that led the houston energy giant to file for the largest bankruptcy in u . s . history .\\n such a pullout could cause short - term disruptions in california if done with little notice , especially on a cold day with many power plant outages and extra demand from holiday light displays , energy officials warned .\\n but the state \\' s relatively new power - buying operation would be up to the task of lining up any extra electricity that might be needed for enron \\' s customers , officials said . they just want as much notification as possible to avoid the frightening shortfalls of last winter and spring , when power buyers frantically scoured the west by phone to scare up any available megawatt to prevent rolling blackouts .\\n \" if the entire amount was dumped back on the grid without giving the grid time to absorb it , that would not be such a good thing , \" said pete garris , acting deputy director in charge of the california department of water resources \\' power - buying division .\\n enron is believed to supply as much as 1 , 400 megawatts of electricity demand by institutional and industrial customers in california , including the university of california and california state university systems . that is equivalent to the usage of slightly more than 1 million average homes , or nearly 4 . 5 % of peak use on a typical winter \\' s day .\\n for nearly a year , dwr has been charged with buying about one - third of the power needed by the customers of southern california edison , pacific gas & electric and san diego gas & electric . a severe cash crunch and the collapse of the state \\' s primary power market left those utilities without the means to buy electricity .\\n enron is best known as an energy trader - - once the world \\' s largest - - and pipeline owner , as well as a politically powerful proselytizer for the deregulation of electricity and other commodities . but the company also runs a fast - growing marketing business that delivers power to industrial customers as a kind of utility surrogate .\\n enron continues to operate under protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code while it comes up with a plan to pay off its more than $ 31 billion in debts .\\n \" so far , the enron situation has not affected the reliability of the electrical system , \" said stephanie mccorkle , spokeswoman for the california independent system operator , which runs the grid of long - distance transmission lines that serves about 70 % of the state .\\n however , some customers have received unsettling \" dear customer \" letters from enron .\\n \" they assured us that things would continue as before , but they also said that they are reviewing the situation , \" said chuck mcfadden , spokesman for the uc system , which uses enron power at seven of nine campuses .\\n the cal state system , which relies on enron to light 19 of 23 campuses , has received no direct communication from enron , said spokeswoman clara potes - fellow .\\n on its web site , enron sought to reassure electricity and natural gas customers that it would continue to provide service . but the company went on to say : \" if . . . for some reason , enron does not provide gas or power , the utility will automatically serve these customers . \"\\n that could be a problem in california , where utilities no longer buy additional power for their customers and regulators have ended the program that allows new customers to pick an electricity provider other than the traditional utility . if enron were to drop customers , they would revert to their former utility , and any extra power would have to be supplied by the state , said terrie prosper , a spokeswoman for the california public utilities commission .\\n \" i don \\' t think it would be a problem , \" she said . \" it \\' s not like a whole city coming online all at once . \"\\n in a signal that enron is already pulling back , the company informed the department of water resources on monday that it would no longer fulfill a short - term contract with the agency to supply 800 megawatt - hours a day of electricity to state buyers .\\n pg & e spokesman john nelson noted that the utility would deliver power to any customer that needs it , but regulators and power buyers would have to work out where that power would come from .\\n gov . gray davis said he doubts enron \\' s bankruptcy filing will have an immediate effect on california , although he predicted it could result in rising wholesale electricity prices in coming days .\\n \" it just shows you what a chancy business electricity deregulation is , \" davis said in mexico city , where he was meeting with president vicente fox .\\n *\\n times staff writer dan morain in mexico city contributed to this report .\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk\\n markets enron , mideast weigh on stocks wall st . : dow declines 0 . 9 % , and nasdaq is down 1 . 3 % . oil prices rise ; bond yields fall .\\n from times staff and wire reports\\n 12 / 04 / 2001\\n los angeles times\\n home edition\\n c -

tech energy company . with alarming speed , enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival .\\n with its future in peril , one of the many uncertainties surrounding enron is the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downtown .\\n when baseball fans file into the stadium for the astros \\' season opener april 2 , will the enormous blue letters spelling enron field still loom large over the centerfield scoreboard ?\\n \" if you were to ask me the question today , it will be called enron field on april 2 , \" said pam gardner , the astros \\' president of business operations . \" but there is so much that could happen . every day could bring a new twist to this deal . . . . we are waiting to see how this plays out . \"\\n for now , enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the astros . the baseball club declined to say when the next payment is due , or how large . the team also declined to say what action it might take if enron fails to deliver the cash on time .\\n for its part , enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal , which is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled in the largest chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history .\\n \" it \\' s like every other pre - petition claim , \" enron spokesman mark palmer said . \" it will become a matter for the bankruptcy judge . \"\\n enron field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity crisis . in baltimore , the super bowl champion ravens play football in a stadium named after a bankrupt internet service provider . but as beleagured as the company is , it has not yet missed a payment , and the place is still called psinet stadium .\\n in st . louis , the rams play football in a dome that had been named after twa . but american airlines bought out the carrier , and the twa name has been removed from the stadium .\\n the rams haven \\' t found another company willing to pony up millions , so the stadium bears the temporary monicker of dome at america \\' s center .\\n as dull as that name is , it \\' s probably better than what you \\' ll find in miami , where the dolphins and marlins play in something called pro player stadium . the biggest problem with that is there \\' s no sportswear company called pro player anymore . it has vanished , although the stadium name remains the same .\\n in past naming - rights deals , the heaviest buyers have been high - tech outfits and airlines . both of those industries are in the tank , and it seems unlikely we \\' ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon .\\n \" it is a period of uncertainty , \" said todd gruen , managing editor of a publication called naming rights deals . \" once we get a handle on where the economy is going , the naming rights industry can find its place as well . \"\\n just how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers .\\n the team \\' s multimillionaire owner , tom hicks , is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington . so far , hicks and the rangers have struck out looking .\\n \" in our weakened economy , everything is kind of on hold , \" rangers president jim lites told the fort worth star - telegram recently .\\n so if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years , the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void .\\n \" i am guessing it will stay enron field for a while , \" gruen said .\\n in addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep - pocketed sponsors , the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill .\\n with no labor contract in place between the owners and the players , the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game . if that weren \\' t bad enough , baseball \\' s own commissioner says the game is bleeding $ 500 million a year , and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring .\\n \" this uncertainty doesn \\' t come at a good time for the astros , \" said dean bonham , chairman of the sports marketing concern called the bonham group . \" major league baseball is on the precipice of a disaster . it is almost assured there will be a work stoppage in the next two seasons . i would categorize the impact of a work stoppage as catastrophic . . . . baseball is in serious turmoil . \"\\n gruen takes a less alarmist view of baseball \\' s future but agrees that prospective sponsors \" will probably want to wait until this labor situation is resolved . \"\\n which is not all bad . gruen thinks the very worst thing the astros could do is jump into a deal with another company that faces an uncertain future .\\n \" enron field is relatively new . it has only had one name , and that will keep the value higher , \" he said . \" the last thing they want to do is get involved with an unstable partner and go through this again in three or four years . that would really damage the stadium rights . \"\\n dec . 4 , 2001 , 5 : 45 pm\\n houston chronicle\\n enron employees : tell us your stories\\n copyright 2001 houston chronicle\\n if you are -

- enron corp . took steps monday to ensure funding for its day - to - day operations , but the company faces a difficult struggle in the months ahead as it tries rebuild itself .\\n in new york monday , u . s . bankruptcy court judge arthur gonzalez approved a plan for a group of lenders led by j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup to lend enron $ 250 million now , another $ 250 million by jan . 7 and , if all goes well , another $ 1 billion after that .\\n the goal is to ensure that enron \\' s core energy trading business survives as a viable entity , by giving other companies confidence they can still do business with enron and expect to be paid .\\n enron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion , said martin bienenstock , an attorney with weil , gotshal & manges , representing enron in the bankruptcy case .\\n enron currently has about $ 500 million in cash on hand , down from about $ 2 . 5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began , bienenstock said .\\n enron may never need to dip into that extra $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , bienenstock said . but just having the funds available eases its financial stress .\\n \" if we don \\' t get this credit , we may need it tomorrow , \" bienenstock told the court monday . \" if we do get it , we may never need it . \"\\n lenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees .\\n enron chief executive officer ken lay , who didn \\' t attend monday \\' s hearing , said in a statement the $ 250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business , such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday \\' s bankruptcy filing .\\n enron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure . bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks .\\n gonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to $ 4 , 500 in severance pay to workers being laid off . workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses .\\n a small number of employees may be eligible for up to $ 15 , 000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code .\\n enron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its $ 219 million office tower that \\' s still under construction in downtown houston . enron has already paid $ 180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project .\\n jeff mcmahon , enron \\' s chief financial officer , was the company \\' s top executive at the hearing . \" i \\' m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all , \" he said during a break in the session .\\n as the bankruptcy progresses , enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations .\\n enron \\' s major creditors will meet on dec . 12 to form a creditors committee , which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money . enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec . 14 .\\n enron \\' s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . corporate history . not surprisingly , gonzalez \\' s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters .\\n enron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron \\' s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company .\\n enron listed assets of $ 49 . 8 billion and liabilities of $ 31 . 2 billion , though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings .\\n as enron decided where to file , it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation \\' s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country , said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist .\\n choosing new york , she said , let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse . and that includes current or laid - off enron workers .\\n monday \\' s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more . despite enron \\' s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type , the odds do not favor it .\\n \" it \\' s challenging , but not impossible , \" said rapoport . \" a lot has to go right . \"\\n eighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts , said jack williams , a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar - in - residence at the american bankruptcy institute , a nonprofit think tank .\\n those that fail - - even those that go in intending to reorganize - - typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case , he said .\\n the biggest potential obstacles to success : a too - small asset base , not enough cash and a poor business plan , he said .\\n as a case unfolds , it \\' s not uncommon for the true value of a company \\' s assets to turn out below the company \\' s numbers , williams said .\\n some companies actually file for chapter 11 , even though they intend to liquidate assets , experts said , as doing so gives them more control over a selloff . under a chapter 7 filing , a court - appointed trustee handles the liquidation .\\n before it filed , enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale . any deals now need approval from the court , with proceeds going to creditors .\\n the creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge , said joel kay , an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes , watters & askanase l . l . p . in houston .\\n that includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court .\\n once a bankruptcy petition is made , the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge , kay said .\\n enron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts , deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed .\\n for those the judge agrees to let enron keep , it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services . companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors .\\n enron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business . but if it wants to sell assets , borrow money or do something out of the ordinary , it must ask .\\n for example , if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation , the court will need to approve .\\n several stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again , even if a new trading joint venture is created .\\n andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy \" are not going to come back to this new entity in droves . \"\\n \" i \\' m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a workable entity out of this chapter 11 , \" he said . \" it \\' s going to be hard for them to reorganize around anything . they may not emerge from chapter 11 . \"\\n he expects shareholders - - generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing - - will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing .\\n the efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted .\\n such lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead .\\n dec . 4 , 2001\\n houston chronicle\\n q & a on the enron bankruptcy\\n why did enron file for bankruptcy ?\\n enron \\' s increasing problems - - particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status - - triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay . filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company .\\n how will the company fund its day - to - day business going forward ?\\n the two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day - to - day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses - - such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance .\\n at this point why would anyone lend them another penny ?\\n after filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor - in - possession financing . lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back . this agreement , which normally pays a top interest rate , has to be approved by other creditors . the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation .\\n who will get paid back ?\\n bankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy . first in line are those with debts secured by the company \\' s property . at the bottom are common shareholders . in the middle are unsecured creditors . however , this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit .\\n if common shareholders are the last to get paid , why did the stock rise ?\\n there \\' s no good explanation . sometimes at the start of a big case , certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders . other buyers are traders who see a short - term profit to be made in the price movement of the stock , which trades in pennies .\\n will enron be able to come back ?\\n that depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to a profitable core . officials within enron have warned the surviving company may be far different than what you see today . often many operations are sold to raise cash to preserve a few key parts .\\n dec . 4 , 2001 , 11 : 23 pm\\n houston chronicle\\n enron \\' s recent troubles\\n aug . 14\\n jeff skilling , who served as ceo for six months , steps down for personal reasons . ken lay assumes the role of ceo . enron \\' s stock closes at $ 42 . 93 , off from a 52 -

off saturday .\\n ` ` seattle didn \\' t disappear after boeing decided it would\\n move , \\' \\' brown said . ` ` we have 20 other fortune 500 companies . . . .\\n one company \\' s problems will not impact the other strong companies\\n we have . \\' \\'\\n state officials were more forthcoming . texas governor rick\\n perry directed the texas workforce commission to send rapid\\n response teams to houston to begin assistance programs for fired\\n workers , spokesman gene acuna said .\\n enron filed yesterday for bankruptcy protection , the biggest\\n such filing in u . s . history , after business began to collapse in\\n october because it wrote off more than $ 1 billion in failed\\n investments amid a $ 1 . 2 billion loss in shareholder equity .\\n investors continued to lose confidence in the company when it\\n restated more than four years of earnings . enron sought to merge\\n with dynegy inc . , but that agreement fell through last week ,\\n forcing the largest energy trader to seek reorganization in\\n bankruptcy court .\\n enron shares , which have fallen 99 percent this year , rose 14\\n cents to 40 cents . dynegy , which is being sued for $ 10 billion by\\n enron for breaking the merger agreement , fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10\\n percent , to $ 27 . 17 .\\n tide of loss\\n the tide of employees that emerged from enron \\' s glass\\n building monday , when the company told most of its workers to go\\n home and await word on their jobs , may have repercussions\\n throughout houston \\' s downtown area , affecting new office projects\\n as well as small businesses , houstonians said .\\n the gateway newsstand , situated between enron and a large\\n parking garage , would lose about 30 percent of its business if the\\n energy trader were to cut all of its jobs , owner noor kamdar said .\\n enron workers on lunch break usually crowd the shop for\\n cigarettes , soft drinks and sandwiches .\\n ` ` it has been slow just the past few days , like a holiday , \\' \\'\\n kamdar said . ` ` i guess we will have to find a new crowd . \\' \\'\\n houston \\' s downtown has been the focus of an intense\\n revitalization effort in recent years , as residential developers\\n build expensive loft apartments and commercial builders construct\\n four new office complexes .\\n about 150 , 000 people work in downtown houston , said laura van\\n ness , director of business development for economic development\\n group central houston inc . the number of people living downtown\\n grew 4 . 5 percent in 2001 , and is expected to increase 15 percent\\n annually for the next five years , she said .\\n office projects\\n enron is completing a second office tower to match its\\n mirrored headquarters . work on the project continues , with\\n completion expected in mid - january , according to hines , the real\\n estate company that \\' s developing the project . enron today received\\n permission from a bankruptcy judge to spend as much as $ 40 million\\n to finish the tower .\\n that will put about a million square feet of office space on\\n the downtown market , said dan bellows , president of commercial\\n broker staubach & co . \\' s houston office .\\n ` ` it \\' ll definitely create a little more vacancy downtown , \\' \\'\\n bellow said , who estimated vacancy rates could climb to 10 percent\\n from 5 percent now . still , enron \\' s buildings are expected to be in\\n high demand in a market lacking large blocks of space for major\\n new entrants .\\n ` ` there are several large companies in this city who have\\n already expressed interest in one or more of the buildings if they\\n come available , \\' \\' bellows said .\\n other major downtown office projects under construction are\\n pre - leased to anchor tenants that include energy traders reliant\\n inc . and calpine corp . , bellows said .\\n development postponed\\n work on all the projects continues . trammel crow co . ,\\n however , postponed its $ 108 million , 34 - story office development\\n because of uncertainty about the impact enron \\' s collapse will have\\n on demand .\\n perhaps the most visible loss to houston will be the prestige\\n associated with the company \\' s name , which adorns the downtown\\n ballpark , enron field . the trader is among three of the city \\' s\\n most visible employers to hit hard times . layoffs were announced\\n earlier this year at continental airlines inc . , where demand\\n dropped following the attacks in new york and washington , and at\\n compaq computer corp . , which is being bought by hewlett - packard\\n co .\\n ` ` if you \\' re the ( chamber of commerce ) , you \\' re out scrambling\\n around for a new icon , \\' \\' said barton smith , an economist at the\\n university of houston and director of the institute for regional\\n forecasting . ` ` enron was the icon for houston for the new energy\\n economy . \\' \\'\\n -
